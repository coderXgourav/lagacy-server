# Backtrack Phase - Detailed Explanation

## 🎯 What is Backtracking?

After the forward pass (Grid 1→16), the system goes **backwards** (Grid 16→1) with **inverse filters** to capture businesses that were missed.

---

## 🔄 Two-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Forward Pass (Grid 1 → 16)
```
Grid 1:  No filter → Gets mostly high-rated (4.5★)
Grid 2:  Sees 4.5★ → Sets max 4.0★ → Gets lower-rated
Grid 3:  Sees 3.2★ → Sets min 3.0★ → Gets higher-rated
...
Grid 16: Final grid with adjusted filter
```

### Phase 2: Backtrack (Grid 16 → 1)
```
Grid 16: Forward got 4.2★ → Backtrack with max 3.5★ (get what we missed)
Grid 15: Forward got 3.1★ → Backtrack with min 3.5★ (get higher-rated)
Grid 14: Forward got 3.8★ → Backtrack with extremes
...
Grid 1:  Fill remaining gaps
```

## 🧠 Why Backtrack?

### Problem Without Backtracking:
```
Forward pass only: 30 businesses
- Mostly captured one rating range per grid
- Missed businesses in opposite rating ranges
- Limited diversity
```

### Solution With Backtracking:
```
Forward + Backtrack: 47 businesses
- Forward pass: 30 businesses (initial capture)
- Backtrack: 17 additional businesses (filled gaps)
- Much better diversity across all rating ranges
```

## 📊 Example Scenario

### Grid 5 (East):

**Forward Pass:**
- Filter: max 4.0★
- Found: 3 businesses (ratings: 3.2, 3.5, 3.8)
- Avg: 3.5★

**Backtrack Pass:**
- Inverse filter: min 3.5★ (opposite of forward)
- Found: 2 NEW businesses (ratings: 4.2, 4.5)
- These were missed in forward pass!

**Total for Grid 5:** 5 businesses (3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 4.2, 4.5) ✅

---

## 🎯 Inverse Filter Logic

```javascript
// Forward pass got high-rated (≥4.0★)
if (forwardAvgRating >= 4.0) {
  backtrackMax = 3.5;  // Get lower-rated in backtrack
}

// Forward pass got low-rated (<3.5★)
else if (forwardAvgRating < 3.5) {
  backtrackMin = 3.5;  // Get higher-rated in backtrack
}

// Forward pass got medium
else {
  // Alternate between extremes
  if (gridIndex % 2 === 0) {
    backtrackMin = 4.0;  // Get very high-rated
  } else {
    backtrackMax = 3.0;  // Get very low-rated
  }
}
```

#### Backtrack Results:
```
Grid 16: 2 NEW (avg 2.8★) - filter: max 3.5 (forward was 4.1)
Grid 15: 1 NEW (avg 4.5★) - filter: min 3.5 (forward was 3.1)
Grid 14: 2 NEW (avg 2.9★) - filter: max 3.0 (forward was 3.8)
Grid 13: 1 NEW (avg 4.7★) - filter: min 4.0 (forward was 3.5)

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### 1. Fills Rating Gaps
Forward pass might miss certain rating ranges. Backtrack fills those gaps.

### 2. More Businesses
Typically adds 30-50% more businesses to results.

### 3. Better Diversity
Ensures you get businesses across the full rating spectrum (2.5-5.0★).

### 4. Maximizes Coverage
Uses the same grids twice with different filters = maximum efficiency.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Deduplication:
- Uses same `seenPlaceIds` set across forward and backtrack
- Prevents duplicate businesses
- Only NEW businesses are added in backtrack

### Lead Limit:
- Stops when lead limit is reached
- Backtrack only runs if forward pass didn't hit limit
- Efficient: doesn't waste API calls

### Performance:
- Forward pass: ~30-60 seconds
- Backtrack: ~20-40 seconds
- Total: ~50-100 seconds
- Worth it for 50% more results!

---

## 🧪 When Backtrack Runs

```javascript
if (allBusinesses.length < limit && gridRatings.length > 0) {
  // Run backtrack
}
```

**Conditions:**
1. Forward pass didn't reach lead limit
2. Forward pass found at least some businesses
3. There's room for more results

**If lead limit reached in forward pass:**
- Backtrack is skipped (no need)
- Saves time and API calls
