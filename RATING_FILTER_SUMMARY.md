# Adaptive Rating Filter - Quick Summary

## 🎯 What It Does

Dynamically adjusts rating filters across 16 grids to capture **diverse businesses** with different ratings (not just high-rated ones).

---

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Grid 1: No filter → Finds mostly 4.5★ businesses
Grid 2: Max 4.0★ → Finds 3.0-4.0★ businesses  
Grid 3: Min 3.0★ → Finds 3.0-5.0★ businesses
Grid 4: Alternate → Balanced mix
...
Grid 16: Final adjustment
```

**Result:** Wide variety from 2.5★ to 5.0★ instead of just 4.5-5.0★
