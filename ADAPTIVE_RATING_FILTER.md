# Adaptive Rating Filter - No Website Finder

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Grid search would return mostly high-rated businesses (4.5-5.0 stars), missing lower-rated businesses that might still be good leads.

**After:** Adaptive rating filter dynamically adjusts across grids to capture a **wide variety** of businesses with different ratings.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Adaptive Strategy:

The system uses a **two-phase approach**:

#### Phase 1: Forward Pass (Grid 1 → 16)
Adjusts rating filter dynamically based on previous grid's average:

```
Grid 1: No filter → Avg rating: 4.5
Grid 2: Max 4.0 (get lower-rated) → Avg rating: 3.2
Grid 3: Min 3.0 (get higher-rated) → Avg rating: 3.8
Grid 4: Alternate filter → Avg rating: 3.5
...
Grid 16: Final adjustment → Avg rating: 3.7
```

#### Phase 2: Backtrack (Grid 16 → 1)
Goes back through grids with **inverse filters** to fill gaps:

```
Grid 16 (backtrack): Forward got 4.2★ → Backtrack with max 3.5★
Grid 15 (backtrack): Forward got 3.1★ → Backtrack with min 3.5★
Grid 14 (backtrack): Forward got 3.8★ → Backtrack with extremes
...
Grid 1 (backtrack): Fill remaining gaps
```

### Decision Logic:

#### Forward Pass:
```javascript
If avg rating >= 4.0:
  → Next grid: Max 4.0 (capture lower-rated businesses)

If avg rating < 3.0:
  → Next grid: Min 3.0 (capture higher-rated businesses)

If avg rating 3.0-4.0:
  → Alternate: Max 3.5 / Min 3.5 (balanced approach)
```

#### Backtrack Pass:
```javascript
If forward got >= 4.0★:
  → Backtrack with max 3.5★ (get what we missed)

If forward got < 3.5★:
  → Backtrack with min 3.5★ (get higher-rated)

If forward got medium:
  → Backtrack with extremes (4.0+ or <3.0)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Rating Filter Parameters:

Google Places API supports:
- `min_rating`: Minimum rating (0.0 - 5.0)
- `max_rating`: Maximum rating (0.0 - 5.0) - *Note: Not officially documented but works*

### Adjustment Algorithm:

```javascript
// High average (≥4.0) → Lower the ceiling
if (avgRating >= 4.0) {
  maxRating = 4.0;
  minRating = null;
}

// Low average (<3.0) → Raise the floor
else if (avgRating < 3.0) {
  minRating = 3.0;
  maxRating = null;
}

// Medium average → Alternate
else {
  if (gridIndex % 2 === 0) {
    maxRating = 3.5;
  } else {
    minRating = 3.5;
  }
}
```
