# Feature Update: Social Media Detection

## What Changed?

### ‚úÖ NEW: Smart Social Media Detection

The No Website Finder now detects when businesses list social media pages (Facebook, Zomato, Instagram, etc.) as their "website" in Google Maps and includes them in results.

---

## Why This Matters

Many businesses don't have real websites but list their social media pages in Google Maps:
- "Website: facebook.com/mybusiness"
- "Website: zomato.com/restaurant"
- "Website: instagram.com/shop"

**Before:** These were excluded (system thought they had websites)
**Now:** These are included (system recognizes social media ‚â† real website)

---

## Detected Platforms

The system now detects these as "not real websites":
- ‚úÖ Facebook
- ‚úÖ Instagram
- ‚úÖ Twitter/X
- ‚úÖ LinkedIn
- ‚úÖ YouTube
- ‚úÖ Zomato
- ‚úÖ Swiggy
- ‚úÖ UberEats
- ‚úÖ Yelp
- ‚úÖ TripAdvisor

---

## Example Results

### Before Update:
```
Search: "Restaurants in Mumbai"
Results: 20 businesses with NO website field at all
```

### After Update:
```
Search: "Restaurants in Mumbai"
Results: 45 businesses
- 20 with no website field
- 15 with Zomato page only
- 8 with Facebook page only
- 2 with Instagram only
```

**Result: 2.25x more leads!**

---

## Data Structure

Each business now includes social media URL if found:

```json
{
  "businessName": "Biryani House",
  "phone": "+91-80-1234-5678",
  "facebookPage": "https://zomato.com/bangalore/biryani-house",
  "address": "123 MG Road, Bangalore",
  "niche": "restaurant"
}
```

Note: Despite the field name "facebookPage", it can store ANY social media URL.

- They're likely interested in a real website

### 3. Richer Data
Social media URLs provide additional outreach channels

1. Change "Facebook" to "Social Media" in UI
2. Update descriptions to mention multiple platforms
3. Test with a new scan

## Testing

Run a scan in an area with restaurants/local businesses:

**Expected Results:**
- Businesses with NO website ‚úÖ
- Businesses with Facebook URL only ‚úÖ
- Businesses with Zomato URL only ‚úÖ
- Businesses with Instagram URL only ‚úÖ
- Businesses with real websites ‚ùå (excluded)

## Real-World Example

**Scan: "Restaurants in Bangalore, India"**

Sample results you might see:

|--------------|-------|--------------|------|
| Spice Garden | +91-80-1234 | zomato.com/spice-garden | Zomato |
